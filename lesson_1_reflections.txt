It allows easy the programmer the access to correct a new bug thats introduced while changing another.It basically keeps records of all the changes ever done which can as useful as a diary entry.
Because diff clearly states those lines where the changes were made and hence would save time for the programmer from inspecting the entire code.
Absent minded ness could lead to great blunders. As well as technical failure of the system might lead to deletion of unsaved files which could cost a lot of unneccesary time.
Saving it as a whole chunk would reduce time swapping between files of the same commit.
Git log is useful for viewing all the commits made one after the other in a sequential order whereas git diff is useful for finding the difference between two commits.
As long as we different commits stored we can always move back to an older save if something goes wrong in the project.It's like exploring a forest with a seccure base camp setup, you can always return back to the safe place.
Carefree modifications can be done.
